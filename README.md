# Differential alteration of plant functions by homologous candidate effectors

Here are the underlying data (files starting with "Data_") for the figures in the paper with the above title (doi: unavailable).
There are also three tables:

- Enriched_GO_terms_WGCNA_sets.txt: complete list of GO terms enriched (GOID, GO term, pValue, number of genes in the set) in each WGCNA gene set of deregulated genes
- Information_deregulated_metabolites.txt: list of deregulated metabolites, ordered by m/z, with putative: molecular formula, identification, search engine used for identification and KEGG database identifier. Also, fold change in each transgenic line is available.
- Selected_reference_genes.txt: Genes selected as reference (using [CustomSelection package](https://github.com/KarenGoncalves/CustomSelection)) were the top 5% genes with lowest TPM covariance among the 45 samples
